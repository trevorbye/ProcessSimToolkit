# ProcessSimToolkit

This is a simplified tool for running stochastic discrete-event process simulations that follow a Server/Queue model. Models are easily built in a building-block format, with easy access to the classes and functions to create custom logic for more-complicated scenarios. Plotting output is included for a histogram output of total system time, as well as live plotting for output mean stabilization used for determining optimal simulation runs.
